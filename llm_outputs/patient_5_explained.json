  "explanation": "**Summary**: The AI assessment predicts a 100% probability of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in patient_5, indicating significant acoustic changes in their voice.\n\n**Key Drivers**: The top contributing features suggest vocal instability and weakness. Specifically:\n\n1. **Spread2** and **D2** indicate an increase in vocal tremor-like patterns, which can be related to the motor symptoms of PD, such as rigidity and bradykinesia.\n2. **Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)** shows a reduced value, indicating increased vocal noise and hoarseness, which is consistent with PD's motor symptoms, particularly tremor.\n\n**Conclusion**: The AI assessment suggests that patient_5's voice biomarkers are indicative of Parkinson's Disease, with features pointing to vocal instability, weakness, and potential motor symptoms. While this prediction has a high confidence level, it is essential to note that this is an AI screening result and not a definitive medical diagnosis. A comprehensive clinical evaluation is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.",
