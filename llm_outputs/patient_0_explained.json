  "explanation": "**Summary**: This AI assessment predicts a healthy individual with 70% confidence, driven by several acoustic features.\n\n**Key Drivers**: The top contributing features indicate altered vocal signal complexity (RPDE), decreased vocal instability/weakness (spread2), and disrupted vocal control dynamics (DFA). These findings suggest that the patient's voice is characterized by reduced complexity, stability, and control.\n\n**Clinical Interpretation**: The combination of these acoustic features suggests that the patient's vocal function is relatively stable and lacks the complex non-linear disruptions typically seen in Parkinson's disease. This may be related to preserved motor function, with minimal rigidity, bradykinesia, or tremor. The prediction of a healthy individual is supported by the overall pattern of acoustic features, which do not suggest significant abnormalities.\n\n**Conclusion**: While this AI assessment does not provide a definitive diagnosis, it suggests that the patient's vocal biomarkers are consistent with a healthy individual. However, it is essential to note that this is an AI screening result and should be used in conjunction with other clinical evaluations to confirm or refute the prediction.",
