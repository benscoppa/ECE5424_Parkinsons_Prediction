  "explanation": "**Clinical Summary**: This AI-assessment predicts a high probability (100%) of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in patient_21, indicating significant abnormalities in their voice biomarkers.\n\n**Key Findings**: The top contributing features suggest irregularities in vocal function, including increased entropy (PPE), disrupted dynamics (DFA), and amplitude perturbations (Shimmer). These findings indicate a breakdown in the normal control of vocal fold vibration, leading to an unstable and weak voice.\n\nThe combination of high Pitch Period Entropy (PPE) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) values suggests complex non-linear disruptions in voice production. Additionally, elevated Shimmer values imply amplitude perturbations, further supporting a diagnosis of PD.\n\n**Reliability**: The strong SHAP impacts for PPE, DFA, and Shimmer suggest that these features are driving the prediction towards PD. The patient's values fall outside normal ranges for all three features, reinforcing the reliability of this assessment. While spread1 and spread2 do contribute to the prediction, their clinical significance is unclear due to lack of normative data. Overall, the pattern of abnormal voice biomarkers supports a high-confidence AI-assessment for PD in patient_21.",
