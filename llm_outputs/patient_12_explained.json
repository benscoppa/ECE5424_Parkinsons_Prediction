  "explanation": "**Summary**: The AI model predicts a high probability of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in patient_12 with 99.3% confidence.\n\n**Key Drivers**: The top contributing features indicate vocal instability, reduced range, and irregular vibration. Specifically:\n\n* **Spread2**: Suggests an increase in PD probability due to vocal instability/weakness.\n* **Maximum Vocal Frequency**: Indicates a reduced range, which may be related to limited vocal control, potentially affecting speech and motor functions.\n* **Pitch Period Entropy**: Reveals increased entropy, indicating irregular vocal fold vibration, which could contribute to motor symptoms like tremor.\n\n**Conclusion**: The AI assessment suggests that patient_12's voice biomarkers are indicative of PD-related changes in vocal function. The reduced range and irregular vibration may be related to motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, or tremor. While this prediction is highly confident, it is essential to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made through clinical evaluation and other diagnostic tests.\n\nThe reliability of this prediction is high due to the presence of multiple features contributing to the PD probability. However, it is crucial for clinicians to consider these findings in conjunction with other assessments and medical history before making a conclusive diagnosis.",
