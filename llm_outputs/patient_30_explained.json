  "explanation": "**Summary**: The AI model predicts Parkinson's Disease with 99.9% confidence, suggesting significant acoustic changes in the patient's voice.\n\n**Key Drivers**: The top contributing features indicate vocal instability and limited control. Spread2 and D2 values are elevated, indicating increased variability and irregularity in vocal production. Maximum Vocal Frequency is reduced, suggesting limited vocal range, while Minimum Vocal Frequency is narrowed, indicating motor impairment. Fundamental Frequency shows reduced variability, implying vocal rigidity.\n\n**Conclusion**: These findings suggest that the patient's voice is characterized by instability, weakness, and limited control, which are consistent with Parkinson's Disease motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. The high confidence prediction is supported by the pattern of features, particularly the combination of elevated spread2 and D2 values, indicating a strong correlation between acoustic changes and PD diagnosis.\n\nAs an AI assessment, this result should be considered in conjunction with other diagnostic tools and clinical evaluations to confirm or rule out Parkinson's Disease.",
