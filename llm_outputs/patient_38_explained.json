  "explanation": "**Summary**: The AI assessment predicts a healthy individual with 99.9% confidence, indicating that the patient's voice biomarkers do not strongly suggest Parkinson's Disease (PD).\n\n**Key Drivers**: The top features contributing to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Spread2**, **Spread1**, and **Pitch Period Entropy (PPE)**: These features indicate a relatively stable and regular vocal function, with minimal signs of instability or weakness.\n2. **Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE)**: Although RPDE is slightly elevated, indicating some changes in vocal signal complexity, this feature's positive SHAP impact only modestly increases the PD probability.\n\n**Conclusion**: The overall pattern suggests a healthy individual with normal vocal function, characterized by stability and regularity. This assessment is supported by the presence of low jitter/shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), and fundamental frequency (Fo) values within normal ranges. These findings are not strongly indicative of PD motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, or tremor.\n\n**Reliability Assessment**: The high confidence level (99.9%) suggests that the AI model has a strong basis for this prediction, driven by the overall pattern of stable and regular vocal function features. However, it is essential to note that this assessment should be considered an AI screening result rather than a definitive diagnosis, as PD can present with varying degrees of motor symptoms and voice changes.",
